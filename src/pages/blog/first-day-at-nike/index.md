title: First Day at Nike
---
Today, I start my first day on an engineering team at Nike. I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Pinch me, please?

I wasn't seeking out an opportunity at Nike (or any other similarly sized/reputed international enterprise), mostly because my previous experience didn't go so well. After my time at Nike's business accelerator (Valiant Labs), I would get approached by recruiters guaranteeing me a contract spot on an engineering team at Nike HQ; I think they saw Nike on my r√©sume and assume I was shoe-in. Nevertheless, after a great deal of positivity from the recruiter on the first call, I'd get a less enthusiastic follow up a week later, and after that ... radio silence.

I was too green. I'd had 8 months at the accelerator after coding bootcamp, and that was the sum total of my professional experience.

After a few months of hustling, I managed to get an interview at Isolary, a boutique software company here in Portland. I didn't get the opportunity through an online job posting, nor did I score it via one of the many web dev meetups I had attended over the previous 5 months. When I was at Epicodus, an alum gave a talk (I can't remember what about), and I discovered he was a dad. I was thrilled because most of my cohort and the other Epicodus students were in their early-mid twenties, just starting their first career. After the talk, I reached out for advice from one junior dev dad to another. We stayed in touch, and it just so happened that he had an acquaintance who was looking for a developer at his agency, Isolary.

Isolary was a small (seriously, 3 people) operation at the time, and they could only pay me half of what I was asking for. I had a 9-month-old at home, no income, and no prospects. I accepted the offer--didn't have much of a choice--and assumed I was gonna blow them away and they'd recognize immediately they needed to quadruple my hourly rate. What hubris.

When I started at Isolary, I planned to apply my beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript/React skills, but they needed me to refamiliarize myself with PHP and learn WordPress yesterday. The first month or two at Isolary were humbling to the say the least. There were days when I found myself on the brink of tears from a combination of impostor syndrome and exhaustion (8-month-old still wasnt sleeping). But somehow, miraculously, I survived. I just didn't give up; I couldn't. And just when I started to feel like my head was fully above water, the lead engineer quit abruptly. Abruptly--like, I came into work and their stuff was gone--abruptly. Yet another sink or swim scenario, but thanks to the previous 3-4 months, I had just mastered the panicked-engineering-butterfly stroke. I treaded water while getting more comfortable in the linux command line, navigating Isolary's servers, and learned to write CI/CD pipeline for GitLab. It was rough, and not always pain-free... particularly for Isolary. But sticking with it, allowed me to learn a ton, build really great relationships with the folks at Isolary and their respective clients.

So, when a recruiter called a month ago about a JavaScript role on a Nike engineering team, I basically laughed at him. "Sure, yeah... go for it. Send them my resume; we'll see what happens," expecting the same radio silence I used to shush my toddler sleep 2 years prior. Shushing is one of the Five S's - get with the program, jeez. Only this time, I got the interview, and then the panel interview, and then the tech lead interview, and then the .... offer?!?! What parallel universe had I slipped into? I felt like I had just started hitting my stride at Isolary, built up the confidence and competence to tackle issues and approach new problems with patience and ease. That said, I longed to be part of a collaborative engineering team; at Isolary I was mostly flying solo.

It was not easy leaving Isolary. No, it was not a dream job, and it paid less than was ideal, but they taught me how to swim. It was and continues to be a scrappy company with a can do attitude; a place that invested in me so long as I invested in it. I wouldn't be the engineer I am today without my experience there. Thank you, Isolary!

So, here I am. First day at Nike. New chapter of this new career, and it feels both exhilarating and terrifying. Fingers crossed.

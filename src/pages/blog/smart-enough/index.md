Ok, I’m no Einstein, but if I’m understanding this quote correctly, he didn’t think he was either. I’m in awe of (and confused by) people for whom mathematics or science comes naturally. Before I read this quote, I thought Einstein was one of those people… those people who just ‘get it.’ I’ve never been one of those people, and I’m elated to learn that neither was Einstein.

While I’m nowhere near accomplishing the things Einstein managed, I do proudly acknowledge that I share his willingness to sit with a question or a problem. Today marks my graduation from a five month program at Epicodus, and if there was any skill that best served me it was my willingness to sit in frustration and discomfort until I pieced together a better understanding of the concept. I would sometimes see a fellow student lose it because they just didn’t get it; “it was just too frustrating!”

During my time at Epicodus, I’ve learned that in order to produce meaningful results or at least better understand a concept or device, I needed to be patient and willing to feel frustrated. It might feel like you’re banging your head against a wall for a day or two, but just because you don’t understand something now doesn’t mean you’ll never understand it.

I imagine some students in my cohort might have attributed my success on a given project to an innate ability or natural talent. Oh, how wrong they’d be… Early on, it took me two full days to get a form with radio buttons and checkboxes to work properly. Two full days on a simple form. It’s uncomfortable not knowing the answer, but as I’ve learned the fundamentals of web development over the last four months, I’ve also learned to get comfortable feeling uncomfortable.

As my first day at an internship approaches, I realize that Einstein’s quote has been and will always be relevant for me as I journey onward in web development. Perhaps I’m not smart enough, but I’m most definitely persistent enough.
